## Installation
- Clone the git repository git clone 
- Create a virtual environment and activate it (Follow Python developer instructions)

The module can be installed in two ways, for production purposes or development purposes.

### Production mode

This mode installs a copy of the module in the site-packages of the virtual environment,
and only installs the modules related to production : cleaning, feature-engineering,
preprocessing and utils. Only the dependencies necessary to use these modules are installed,
such as described in the setup.py.

Activate the virtual environement, then install the module with pip

pip install /path/to/ai-data-preparation

Or with the wheel (located in the current working directory) :

pip install data_preparation-X.X.X-py3-none-any.whl

with X.X.X being the version of the module, for example  0.0.1.
